# Let It Crash: A Lesson in Embracing Failure from 18 Failed Releases

## The Problem That Started It All

We had a simple goal: automatically publish two Rust crates (`zod_gen` and `zod_gen_derive`) to crates.io when we tagged a release. The second crate depends on the first, so we needed to wait for `zod_gen` to be available before publishing `zod_gen_derive`.

Simple, right? 

What followed was 18 versions of increasingly complex failure-avoidance mechanisms that all failed spectacularly.

## The Descent into Complexity

### Version 1.1.8: "Let's check if it's ready!"
```bash
if cargo search zod_gen | grep -q "zod_gen = \"${VERSION}\""; then
  cargo publish -p zod_gen_derive
fi
```

**Result**: Failed. `cargo search` wasn't returning the expected format.

### Version 1.1.9: "Maybe we need the registry flag!"
```bash
if cargo info --registry crates-io zod_gen | grep -q "version: ${VERSION}"; then
  cargo publish -p zod_gen_derive
fi
```

**Result**: Failed. Still finding the local version instead of the published one.

### Versions 1.1.10-1.1.12: "Let's fix the pattern matching!"
We added debug output, tried different grep patterns, filtered status messages, added whitespace trimming...

**Result**: Still failed. The pattern was there, but somehow not matching.

### Versions 1.1.13-1.1.17: "More debugging! More filtering!"
We added comprehensive debug output, discovered multiple version lines, tried exact line matching, two-stage grep approaches...

**Result**: Still failed. We could see the version line clearly, but the pattern matching remained unreliable.

## The Breakthrough: Let It Crash

After 17 failed attempts at predicting when the dependency would be available, someone suggested the obvious:

> "Can't we just retry publishing the zod_gen_derive? If zod_gen is available it will succeed, otherwise it will fail, but we can wait and retry a few times."

### Version 1.1.18: Embrace the Failure
```bash
for i in {1..12}; do
  if cargo publish -p zod_gen_derive; then
    echo "Success!"
    exit 0
  else
    echo "Dependency not ready, retrying in 10 seconds..."
    sleep 10
  fi
done
```

**Result**: ✅ **Worked on the first try.**

## The Lesson: Failure as Signal, Not Enemy

What we learned mirrors the Erlang/OTP philosophy of "Let it crash!" - but applied to automation and workflow design.

### What We Did Wrong
- **Avoided failure**: Built elaborate mechanisms to predict and prevent `cargo publish` from failing
- **Added complexity**: Created fragile parsing logic instead of using the failure as information
- **Ignored the signal**: The failure itself was the perfect indicator of when to retry

### What We Should Have Done
- **Embraced failure**: Let `cargo publish` fail when the dependency isn't ready
- **Used failure as signal**: The failure tells us exactly what we need to know
- **Kept it simple**: Retry the operation directly instead of building prediction mechanisms

## The Broader Pattern

This isn't just about package publishing. The same anti-pattern appears everywhere:

### ❌ Failure Avoidance Anti-Patterns
- Parsing tool output to avoid dependency failures
- Complex health checks instead of retrying operations  
- Elaborate state detection instead of testing actual operations
- Building prediction mechanisms for recoverable failures

### ✅ "Let It Crash" Patterns
- **Database connections**: Retry the query instead of complex health checks
- **API availability**: Retry the API call instead of ping/status endpoints
- **File operations**: Try the operation and handle errors instead of checking permissions
- **Service startup**: Retry dependent operations instead of elaborate readiness probes

## The Decision Framework

When building automation, ask yourself:

1. **Am I trying to predict if an operation will succeed?**
2. **Is the failure recoverable and informative?**
3. **Would the failure tell me exactly what I'm trying to detect?**

If yes to all three: **Let it crash.** Use the failure as your signal.

## Code Examples

### Instead of This (Prediction):
```bash
# Complex detection to avoid failure
if complex_health_check && dependency_ready && state_is_correct; then
  critical_operation
else
  echo "Not ready yet"
fi
```

### Do This (Embrace Failure):
```bash
# Let the operation tell us when it's ready
for i in {1..N}; do
  if critical_operation; then
    echo "Success!"
    exit 0
  else
    echo "Not ready, retrying..."
    sleep 10
  fi
done
```

## Why This Works Better

1. **Simpler**: No complex parsing or state detection
2. **More reliable**: Uses the actual operation's built-in logic
3. **Self-correcting**: Automatically succeeds when conditions are right
4. **Clearer feedback**: Failures provide exact information about what's wrong
5. **Less fragile**: No dependency on output formats or external state

## The Meta-Lesson

The real insight isn't about avoiding complex parsing - it's about **embracing failure as information rather than something to avoid**.

In our case:
- **18 versions** of trying to avoid the failure
- **1 version** of embracing it and using it as signal

The failure wasn't the problem - our avoidance of it was.

## Conclusion

Sometimes the most elegant solution is to stop trying to be clever and just let the system tell you what it needs. The failure itself often contains exactly the information you were trying to detect.

As the Erlang community learned decades ago: **Let it crash.** The crash is not your enemy - it's your most reliable source of truth.
