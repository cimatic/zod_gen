## [1.1.3] - 2025-07-30

### üîß Development Experience Improvements

This release focuses on improving the development experience and ensuring consistency between local development and CI environments.

#### Added
- **Native Git Pre-commit Hook**: Automatically runs rustfmt, clippy, tests, and example verification before each commit
- **Rust Toolchain Pinning**: Added `rust-toolchain.toml` to ensure consistent Rust version across environments
- **CI Consistency Scripts**: 
  - `scripts/clippy-ci.sh` - Run clippy with exact CI flags locally
  - `scripts/debug-clippy.sh` - Troubleshoot clippy differences between local and CI
- **Development Documentation**: Comprehensive `DEVELOPMENT.md` with setup and troubleshooting guides
- **Hook Setup Script**: `scripts/setup-hooks.sh` for verifying pre-commit hook installation

#### Changed
- **API Cleanup**: Simplified `zod_gen/src/lib.rs` by removing unused wrapper methods
- **Format String Compliance**: Updated format strings in `zod_gen_derive` to comply with `clippy::uninlined-format-args`
- **Enhanced README**: Added development tooling section with links to new documentation

#### Fixed
- **CI Consistency**: Resolved local vs CI clippy differences that could cause unexpected CI failures
- **Code Quality**: Ensured all code passes strict clippy lints matching CI configuration

This release ensures developers can't accidentally commit code that will fail CI, significantly improving the development workflow.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-30

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Added
- **Serde Rename Support**: Full support for `#[serde(rename = "...")]` attributes on enum variants
  - TypeScript schemas now use the renamed values instead of Rust variant names
  - Provides compile-time type safety between Rust serialization and TypeScript
  - Example: `#[serde(rename = "active")]` generates `z.literal("active")` instead of `z.literal("Active")`

#### Enhanced
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Added `serde_rename_test.rs` demonstrating rename functionality
- **Better Documentation**: Updated README with serde rename examples and use cases

This feature closes the gap between Rust serialization and TypeScript type checking, ensuring developers can't accidentally use incorrect string literals.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-29

### üéâ Initial Stable Release

This is the first stable release of `zod_gen` with a clean, simplified API.

### ‚ú® Features

- **ZodSchema Trait**: Simple trait with only `zod_schema()` method
- **Derive Macro**: `#[derive(ZodSchema)]` for automatic schema generation
- **ZodGenerator**: Single-file TypeScript output with user-controlled naming
- **Generic Type Support**: Built-in support for `Option<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `HashMap<String, T>`
- **Inline Schemas**: Self-contained schemas with no external dependencies
- **TypeScript Integration**: Automatic type inference using `z.infer<typeof Schema>`

### üèóÔ∏è Supported Types

#### Primitives
- `String`, `i32`, `i64`, `u32`, `u64`, `f32`, `f64`, `bool`
- `serde_json::Value`

#### Generics
- `Option<T>` ‚Üí `T.nullable()`
- `Vec<T>` ‚Üí `z.array(T)`
- `HashMap<String, T>` ‚Üí `z.record(z.string(), T)`

#### Custom Types
- Structs with named fields ‚Üí `z.object({ ... })`
- Enums with unit variants ‚Üí `z.union([z.literal('A'), z.literal('B')])`

### üìö API

```rust
// Manual implementation
impl ZodSchema for MyType {
    fn zod_schema() -> String {
        // Return Zod schema string
    }
}

// Derive macro
#[derive(ZodSchema)]
struct User {
    id: u64,
    name: String,
}

// Generator
let mut gen = ZodGenerator::new();
gen.add_schema::<User>("User");
let typescript = gen.generate();
```

### üéØ Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Minimal API surface with maximum functionality
- **User Control**: Users provide TypeScript type names explicitly
- **Single Responsibility**: Library only generates Zod schemas
- **Zero Magic**: Predictable behavior with no hidden complexity
- **TypeScript First**: Designed for seamless Zod integration

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-30

### ‚ú® Added

- **Serde Rename Support**: Automatic handling of `#[serde(rename = "...")]` attributes on enum variants
  - Enum variants with serde rename generate TypeScript literal types using the renamed values
  - Ensures perfect alignment between Rust serialization and TypeScript types
  - Provides compile-time type safety to catch serialization mismatches

### üéØ Type Safety Improvements

- TypeScript now catches typos when using enum values (e.g., `'Active'` vs `'active'`)
- Generated schemas use serde-renamed values for runtime validation
- Maintains backward compatibility for enums without serde rename

### üìö Examples

```rust
#[derive(ZodSchema, Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum Status {
    #[serde(rename = "active")]
    Active,
    #[serde(rename = "inactive")]
    Inactive,
}
```

Generates:
```typescript
export const StatusSchema = z.union([z.literal('active'), z.literal('inactive')]);
export type Status = z.infer<typeof StatusSchema>;
```

## [1.1.7] - 2025-08-01

### üêõ Fixed

#### Release Workflow Bug Fix
- **Fixed Version Display in Release Workflow**: Corrected double `v` prefix in logging messages
  - Changed `v${VERSION}` to `${VERSION}` since `github.ref_name` already includes `v` prefix
  - Prevents confusion in release logs and ensures proper version tracking
  - This fixes the "vv1.1.6" issue seen in release logs

#### Technical Details
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` wait step logging
- Removed duplicate `v` prefix from version display messages
- No API changes, only release process improvement

## [1.1.6] - 2025-08-01

### üöÄ Improved

#### Release Process Enhancements
- **Fixed GitHub Actions Release Workflow**: Resolved dependency order issue in automated releases
  - Updated dry run validation to only check `zod_gen` since `zod_gen_derive` depends on unpublished version
  - Replaced fixed 30-second wait with intelligent polling that checks crates.io availability
  - Fixed version pattern matching to handle `v1.1.6` vs `1.1.6` format differences
  - Ensures reliable automated releases for future versions

#### Technical Details
- Modified `.github/workflows/release.yml` to handle package dependencies correctly
- Added intelligent version availability checking with retry logic
- Improved error handling and logging in release workflow
- This change only affects the release process, not the library API

## [1.1.5] - 2025-08-01

### üêõ Fixed

#### Critical Bug Fix
- **Parcel Bundler Compatibility**: Fixed import statement generation to use `import * as z from 'zod';` instead of `import { z } from 'zod';`
  - Resolves runtime error `i.z.string is not a function` when bundled with Parcel
  - Ensures Zod validation works correctly in Parcel-based applications
  - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing functionality

#### Technical Details
- Updated `ZodGenerator::generate()` method in `zod_gen/src/lib.rs`
- Updated all documentation examples to use the correct import format
- Updated tests to verify the new import statement
- This change affects generated TypeScript files but maintains API compatibility

## [1.1.8] - 2025-08-01

### üêõ Fixed

#### Release Workflow Reliability Fix
- **Fixed Version Availability Check**: Replaced unreliable `cargo search | grep` with `cargo info --version` for checking package availability
  - Resolves issue where `cargo search` doesn't return packages in expected format in GitHub Actions environment
  - Uses `cargo info zod_gen --version ${VERSION}` which returns proper exit codes for version existence
  - Ensures reliable automated releases by eliminating dependency on output format parsing
  - Fixes the "did not become available after 2 minutes" error in release workflow

#### Technical Details
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` wait step to use `cargo info` instead of `cargo search`
- More reliable version checking that doesn't depend on parsing output format
- No API changes, only release process improvement

## [1.1.9] - 2025-08-01

### üêõ Fixed

#### Release Workflow Final Fix
- **Fixed Version Availability Check**: Updated to use `cargo info zod_gen | grep -q "version: ${VERSION_WITHOUT_V}"` for reliable package availability detection
  - This approach is more reliable than previous attempts as it uses the standard cargo info output format
  - Resolves the persistent "did not become available after 2 minutes" error in GitHub Actions
  - Ensures automated releases work consistently by checking for the version string in cargo info output
  - Final fix for the release workflow that was causing multiple release failures

#### Technical Details
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` line 85 with the correct cargo info and grep pattern
- Uses the standard cargo info output format which includes "version: X.Y.Z" line
- No API changes, only release process improvement

## [1.1.10] - 2025-08-01

### üêõ Fixed

#### Release Workflow Registry Fix
- **Fixed Local vs Registry Version Confusion**: Updated `cargo info` to use `--registry crates-io` flag to force checking published version instead of local version
  - Previous attempts were failing because `cargo info zod_gen` was returning the local project version `(from ./zod_gen)` instead of the crates.io published version
  - The `--registry crates-io` flag ensures cargo checks the actual published version on crates.io
  - This should finally resolve the persistent "did not become available after 2 minutes" error
  - Removes debug output line that was added for troubleshooting

#### Technical Details
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` to use `cargo info --registry crates-io zod_gen`
- Forces cargo to check the registry version instead of finding the local project
- No API changes, only release process improvement

## [1.1.11] - 2025-08-01

### üêõ Fixed

#### Release Workflow Registry Flag Application Fix
- **Fixed Missing Registry Flag**: Properly applied `--registry crates-io` flag to both cargo info commands in the release workflow
  - Previous fix was incomplete - the debug line still used `cargo info zod_gen` without the registry flag
  - Now both the debug output (removed) and the actual check use `--registry crates-io` to ensure consistent behavior
  - Removes the debug output line that was showing local version instead of registry version
  - This should finally resolve the version availability check issue

#### Technical Details
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` to properly apply `--registry crates-io` flag
- Removed debug output line that was causing confusion
- Ensures all cargo info commands check the registry version, not local version
- No API changes, only release process improvement
